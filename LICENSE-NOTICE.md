# Voiceym — License Notice

## Abbreviation

AGPL-3.0-only

## Notice

Voiceym is a modified version of **VoiceStudio**
(<https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio>), forked at upstream commit
`73df166` on 2026-10-20 and renamed. Changes since the fork are recorded in
this repository's git history.

Copyright 2024-present Palash Debnath and VoiceStudio contributors.
Modifications copyright 2026-present the Voiceym contributors.

Voiceym is **free and open-source software, licensed under the GNU Affero
General Public License, Version 3 (AGPL-3.0)**, the same license as the
upstream project. You are free to use, copy, modify, and redistribute it,
including for commercial and internal business use.

Because this is the **Affero** GPL, if you modify Voiceym and make that
modified version available to others over a network, you must also offer
those users the complete corresponding source code of your modified version
under these same AGPL-3.0 terms. See the full text in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).

Model weights, tokenizers, and other third-party assets retain their own
terms; this application license does not grant or summarize rights under
those separate terms.

(This Notice is a plain-language summary; the binding terms are the full GNU
AGPL-3.0 text in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).)

### Scope

These terms cover the Voiceym application — the Electron desktop and web
app (`electron/`), its native desktop helper (`native/`), the FastAPI backend
(`backend/`), and supporting build / packaging files (`scripts/`, `deploy/`,
`.github/`). Electron components adapted from T3 Code keep their MIT notice in
`electron/T3CODE-LICENSE.txt`.

The bundled `omnivoice/` Python package — the underlying TTS model by Han Zhu —
is **separately licensed under Apache License 2.0** by its upstream authors and
is not relicensed here. Apache License 2.0 is compatible with, and may be
combined under, the GNU AGPL-3.0. See `pyproject.toml`.

Downloaded model weights are not relicensed by Voiceym. The default
`k2-fsa/OmniVoice` model card identifies its code as Apache-2.0 and pretrained
weights as CC-BY-NC. Its `audio_tokenizer/LICENSE` contains separate Boson
Higgs Audio 2 and Meta Llama community terms. 

The maintained About panel displays selected model credits and required literal
Higgs Audio and Llama attribution text. See [model credit sources](docs/model-credits.md)
for evidence and remaining gaps. These visible credits do not establish complete
notice compliance or permission for a particular use.

The [model licence records](backend/config/model_licenses.json) distinguish
inspected non-commercial terms from unreviewed upstream metadata. A false
commercial-use flag includes unresolved review; it is not a claim that every
listed model forbids commercial use. No commercial clearance is asserted by
the initial inventory.

The Model Manager's versioned notices distinguish commercial model use,
commercial output use, redistribution and voice/recording consent. An unknown
assessment is not permission and is not a finding that all uses are prohibited.
Evidence for one revision or conversion does not automatically cover another.

The optional [reviewed-file workflow](docs/licensing/model-review-workflow.md)
records a local acknowledgement of the displayed notice and exact evidence.
It does not accept agreements with a provider, grant provider access, grant
commercial rights, verify voice consent or add a waiver. It does not alter
rights granted by the application's AGPL licence. Existing engine settings and
ordinary download/first-use paths remain separate and unchanged; no production
model currently has the complete evidence needed for this reviewed workflow.

Third-party dependencies retain their own licenses. See `bun.lock`, `uv.lock`,
and `native/desktop-bridge/Cargo.lock` for the resolved set.

The locked PyAV 15.1.0 wheels bundle FFmpeg and x264/x265 libraries. PyAV's source
licence alone does not describe those binaries' terms. The
[wheel audit](docs/licensing/pyav-15.1.0-audit.md) records their hashes, build flags,
upstream licence-label patch, and unresolved redistribution requirements.

### Reference

The full canonical text of the GNU Affero General Public License, Version 3 is
reproduced verbatim in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE). The authoritative copy lives at
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt>.

> **Why this notice is a separate file:** `LICENSE` must contain the verbatim
> AGPL-3.0 text and nothing else, so GitHub's license detection (and the
> corporate license scanners that gate adoption) can identify it as
> `AGPL-3.0-only` rather than falling back to "Other" / `NOASSERTION`.
